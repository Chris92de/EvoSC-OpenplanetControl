# EvoSC Openplanet Control

This module allows you to control whether a player can play on your server when they are joining with Openplanet enabled.

## config

`auto-kick`: If true, players with Openplanet running will be kicked when joining. If false, only a warning in the logs and ingame to admins are shown.
